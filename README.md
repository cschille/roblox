Solutions for *Roblox* pre-interview exercises, with gratuitous embellishments for more fun.

# Details
Q1. Write a function and list unit test cases for the following.

A function that takes two sorted integer lists as input and returns a merged sorted list as output. Duplicate list entries are preserved in the output.  The function should prioritize run-time efficiency.

Unit tests can simply be enumerated as input/output pairs in a format similar to the sample below.
 Sample input and output: [0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 4, 5] => [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]


Q2. Write a function and list unit test cases for the following.

A function that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum product that can be derived from any three integers in the list. An Argument Exception is thrown for any input values that will not produce a valid Int32 product.

Unit tests can simply be enumerated as input/output pairs in a format similar to the sample below.
 Sample input and output:  [10, 3, 0, -2,  12, 5, 1, 1, 4] => 600  // 10*12*5 = 600
